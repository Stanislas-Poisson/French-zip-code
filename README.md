Dataset of the regions, departments, communes and postal codes of France (metropolitan France, DROM and COM), with **one GPS point per postal code** and the **history of changes** (mergers, code changes, creations, deletions).

It is built from official open sources, updated automatically, and designed so that an application can attach its addresses to it through a foreign key.

## What the dataset contains

| Table | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| `regions` | The regions (code, name). |
| `departments` | The departments and the overseas collectivities (code, name, region). |
| `communes` | The communes and the municipal arrondissements, with their INSEE code, their department and the centre of the commune. |
| `cities` | **One row per commune and per postal code**, for example "37200 Tours", with its GPS point. |
| `commune_successions` | For an old INSEE code, the code that succeeds it, the nature of the change and its date. |
| `reference_changes` | The changes detected between two updates (regions, departments, postal codes). |

Every table carries a validity period (`valid_from`, `valid_to`): a row is never deleted, its validity is closed. Identifiers are therefore stable over time.

```
regions ──< departments ──< communes ──< cities <── addresses (table of your application)
```

### One GPS point per postal code

Tours (37261) has three postal codes, and each one has its own point:

| Postal code | Latitude | Longitude | Addresses used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 37000 | 47.3858 | 0.6886 | 18,746 |
| 37100 | 47.4164 | 0.6930 | 10,489 |
| 37200 | 47.3661 | 0.7044 | 1,007 |

The point of a postal code is the **median of the address positions** of the [Base Adresse Nationale][ban] (BAN) for that postal code in that commune. The `coordinate_source` column always tells where the point comes from:

1. `ban`: median of the BAN addresses (the vast majority of cities).
2. `nominatim`: search of the postal code and the commune on [Nominatim][nominatim], for cities with no address in the BAN.
3. `commune_centre`: centre of the commune, as the last fallback.

`address_count` gives the number of addresses used: a postal code with very few addresses is less reliable.

## Sources and licences

| Source | Usage | Licence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [INSEE, Code officiel géographique][insee-cog] | Regions, departments, communes, history since 1943 and commune events. | Licence Ouverte |
| [La Poste, base officielle des codes postaux][laposte] | Link between a commune and its postal codes. | Licence Ouverte |
| [geo.api.gouv.fr][geo-api] | Centre of each commune. | Licence Ouverte |
| [Base Adresse Nationale][ban] | GPS point of each postal code. | Licence Ouverte |
| [Nominatim][nominatim] (OpenStreetMap) | Fallback for cities with no address in the BAN. | ODbL |

## Attaching addresses

An application stores its addresses with a foreign key to `cities`:

```php
$city = City::current()
    ->where('postal_code', '37200')
    ->whereRelation('commune', 'insee_code', '37261')
    ->firstOrFail();

$address = Address::create([
    'line'    => '3 rue Jules Massenet',
    'city_id' => $city->id,
]);

$address->city
    ->commune
    ->department
    ->region
    ->name; // Centre-Val de Loire
```

For the `addresses.city_id` foreign key to work, the `cities` table must live in the same database as `addresses`.

## Migrating old codes

When a commune merges or changes its code, its old codes keep pointing to it through `commune_successions`. Example: Saint-Florent-des-Bois merged in 2016 into "Rives de l'Yon", which took over the code **85213**, while Chaillé-sous-les-Ormeaux (85043) was absorbed.

```bash
make resolve CODE=85043 POSTAL_CODE=85310
# 2016-01-01  absorbed: 85043 -> 85213
# 2016-01-01  code_reused: 85213 -> 85213
# Current communes: 85213
# city #33125  85310  RIVES DE L YON  (46.590263, -1.333875)
```

The result follows succession chains (A to B to C), reports a commune that **disappeared without a successor**, lists every successor of a split commune and warns when the original postal code is no longer in use. The same information is in the exported files (`commune_successions`, and `replaced_by_city_id` in `cities`) so you can migrate your data without going through this repository.

### Limits of the history

- For communes, departments and regions, the history goes back to 1943 (the overseas COM have none before the first import).
- INSEE publishes no event for **postal codes**: their tracking relies on the comparison between two updates and **starts at the first import kept**.

## Usage

Requirements: [Docker][docker] and [Make][make].

```bash
make start      # starts PHP 8.4, MySQL 8.4, Redis and Horizon, installs the dependencies, migrates the database
make update     # updates the dataset (official files, then GPS points), on the queue
make status     # state of the dataset and of the last update
make export     # exports to CSV, JSON and SQL in storage/app/exports
make stop       # stops the project and removes its containers and volumes
```

`make update` downloads the official files and only re-imports the ones that changed. The GPS points are computed by parallel jobs, one per department, then a check verifies that **every city has a point**, that **every department was processed** and that no job failed. A full update takes about 15 minutes.

The matching `php artisan` commands:

- `dataset:update` _(`--sync`, `--force`, `--skip-coordinates`)_
- `dataset:status`
- `dataset:resolve`
- `dataset:export`.

## Published files

The exports are attached to the [releases][releases] of the repository and published on [data.gouv.fr][data-gouv]. They contain one file per table, in CSV, JSON and SQL.

## Development

```bash
make quality    # Pint, PHPStan (max level), Rector, PHPInsights, Markdownlint
make test       # PHPUnit
```

The repository uses [`zairakai/laravel-dev-tools`][dev-tools] (quality tools, git hooks, Makefile).  
Commits follow Conventional Commits with the ticket number (`type(scope): #123 subject`) and the repository only accepts merge commits on rebased branches.  
The architecture is described in [`docs/architecture.md`][architecture] and how to publish a version in [`docs/release.md`][release].

## Licence

[MIT][license] for the code. The data remain subject to the licences of their sources (see above).
